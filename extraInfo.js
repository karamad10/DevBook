//Disable Sessions

//After successful authentication, Passport will establish a persistent login session.
//This is useful for the common scenario of users accessing a web application via a browser.However,
//in some cases, session support is not necessary.For example,
//API servers typically require credentials to be supplied with each request.
//When this is the case, session support can be safely disabled by setting the session option to false.

//npm run dev
